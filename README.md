# todo-app
This is a simple Todo app that I built with Flutter. It will be updated soon because there are some bugs and incomplete features.

What I practiced and learned from this project:

  -Working with FirebaseAuth and Cloud Firestore, including querying over the Firestore database via Streams, Futures, data models, and object-oriented programming (OOP) classes.
  -Handling null safety errors and unexpected bugs.
  - Managing authentication state.

What will be improved in the next version:

 - I will handle navigation in better ways (I just realized that I have less information about it).
 - Existing bugs will be resolved.
 - Some new Todo features will be added, such as deadline reminders.
 - Data will also be stored locally, depending on the internet connection state.
